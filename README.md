This is a project about studying the survival of the titanic passengers.

Models: 1.Logistic Regression 2.KNN 3.Naive bayes

Results: 1.For Logistic Regression model, the accuracy is 0.82.
         2.For KNN model, the highest accuracy appears to be 0.75 when k is 6.
 	 3.For Naive Bayes model, the accuracy is 0.83.

Conclusion: The Naive Bayes model is the best model since it has the best accuracy.
